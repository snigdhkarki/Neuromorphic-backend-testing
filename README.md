<h1>RISP GUI Simulator</h1>

An open-source, interactive web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) simulator for the RISP Neuroprocessor, built on top of the TENNLab Exploratory Neuromorphic Framework.

While the official TENNLab framework provides robust Command Line Interface (CUI) tools (`network_tool` and `processor_tool_risp`), this project bridges the gap by offering an intuitive, visual platform to design, simulate, and analyze spiking neural networks (SNNs) in real-time.

<h2> Features</h2>

* **Visual Network design:** Interactive rendering of spiking neural network topologies, neurons, and synaptic connections.
* **Input Spike design:** Ability to design both dense input spike and sparse input spikes.
* **Easy simulation:** Easily find the result of certain input spike on a SNN.

<h2>Tech Stack & Deployment</h2>

<h3>Frontend</h3>

* **Framework:** React 
* **Deployment:** Vercel

<h3>Backend</h3>

* **Core Engine:** TENNLab C++ code
* **Containerization:** Docker (compiles and packages the C++ framework dependencies flawlessly)
* **Deployment:** Render

<h2> Local Development </h2>

If you want to make changes to the code, follow these steps to run the repository locally:

### 1. Fork and Clone

* **Fork** the repository https://github.com/snigdhkarki/Neuromorphic-Processor-UI to your own GitHub account.
* Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/snigdhkarki/Neuromorphic-Processor-UI
```

### 2. Running the Pages
The project is divided into 4 distinct folders, each representing a page of the website. To run a specific page:

Navigate into any of the four project folders:

```bash
cd folder-name
```
Install the dependencies (if you haven't already):

```bash
npm install
```
Start the local development server:

```bash
npm start
```
Note: Repeat this process inside any of the other folders to spin up the respective pages of the website.

### 3. To Run the Backend Locally
Follow these steps to get your local development server up and running.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed on your machine.

Clone the Repository
Clone the backend repository https://github.com/snigdhkarki/Neuromorphic-backend-testing to your local machine

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/snigdhkarki/Neuromorphic-backend-testing
```

Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

```Bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install Dependencies
Install the required packages before running the server:

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Application
Start the local FastAPI development server using Uvicorn with auto-reload enabled:

```Bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
